# Gaia-Reborn

Gaia-Reborn is a revived and modernized fork of the original [mozilla-b2g/gaia](https://github.com/mozilla-b2g/gaia), the user interface of Firefox OS.

## About

This project aims to bring the classic Gaia UI from Firefox OS back to life with updates and improvements, making it accessible and usable again in a modern context.

## Raspberry Pi Image

We are working on providing ready-to-use Gaia-Reborn images for Raspberry Pi models 0 through 4. These images will allow you to experience Gaia-Reborn running on Raspberry Pi hardware, bringing the Firefox OS UI to life on affordable and popular devices.

## Credits

All credits for the original Gaia UI go to Mozilla and the Firefox OS community for their pioneering work.

## Getting Started

*Instructions for downloading and flashing the Raspberry Pi image will be added soon.*

## Contributions

Contributions, suggestions, and feedback are welcome. Feel free to open issues or pull requests.
